        <p>
            Hi my name is Omar Fofana I'm second year computer science major at quinnipiac university. My whole life I've been a pretty big gamer. I mainly played
            on console. Some of my favorite games all of time are black ops 2, skate 3 and dying light. I took my first computer
            science class in high school my junior year as a elective. At first I hated it and said to myself I would never
            take other class like that. But in the end I ended up loving it and took a college level course the next year and then 
            decided to come to quinnipiac as a computer science major.
